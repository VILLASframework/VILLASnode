# Getting started

We put some effort in getting you started as smooth as possible.

1. Download the Docker toolbox: https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox .
   This toolbox includes a virtual machine as well all the Docker tools you need to the Docker container which is provided by us.
   More instructions to get with can be found here: http://docs.docker.com/windows/started/

2. After installing the toolbox, open the "Docker Quickstart Terminal"

3. Start the latest S2SS container by running:

    $ docker run rwthacs/s2ss
