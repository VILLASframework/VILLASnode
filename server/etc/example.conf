# Example configuration file for the S2SS server
#
# This example includes all valid configuration options for the server.
# Please note, that using all options at the same time does not really
# makes sense. The purpose of this example is to serve as a reference.
#
# The syntax of this file is similar to JSON.
# A detailed description of the format can be found here:
