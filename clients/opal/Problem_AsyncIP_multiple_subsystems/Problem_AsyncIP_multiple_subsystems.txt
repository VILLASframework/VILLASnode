Problem occurs when there are multiple subsystems (SM_, SS_, ...)

Even there is no OpAsyncIPCtrl in all subsystems, RT-Lab during building process wants to generate AsyncIP exe, if there is no OpAsyncIPCtrl it shows error

Workaround for now: place fake OpAsyncIPCtrl in each subsystem

Additional problem: After Load, only AsyncIP in SM_ is started

Zapravo: this helps that you do not need fake blocks:

.llm file should contain the following:
note: path to libOpalAsyncApiCore.a depends on version of RT-Lab  

[ExtraPutFilesComp]
C:\OPAL-RT\RT-LAB\v10.7.7.506\common\lib\redhawk\libOpalAsyncApiCore.a=Binary

but it seems that still you can you it only in SM_...
