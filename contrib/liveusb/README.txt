S2SS LiveUSB Image
===================================================================

This archive contains an image of Fedora installation
which has been tuned for low latency and overall performance.
It facilitates the setup of a S2SS instance and is designed to be used
by partners of the Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS).

This image will automatically request an IP address via DHCP
and create a SSH tunnel to the central orchestration server.
This allows further configuration and control.

The default credentials are:

	User: root
	Password: s2ss-admin

Copy image with bundled tool [1] to a USB stick or a harddisk.
The image is about 2GB in size.
IMPORTANT: All contents of the stick will be wiped! Make backups!
